# To-Do App Backend

This repository contains the backend API for the To-Do List app. The backend serves as the core service to manage tasks, user authentication, and other app-related functionalities. It provides a RESTful API for interacting with the app's front end.

---

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks and user data are stored in a database.
- **Basic Controllers**: Sample controllers for basic testing and setup.

---

## Project Structure

The backend project is organized as follows:

- `controllers/` # Contains controller files for routing logic
- `config/` # Configuration files (e.g., database, environment settings)
  - `db.js` # Database connection setup
- `server.js` # Entry point for the backend server
- `.gitignore` # Git ignore file (excludes node_modules, .env files, etc.)
- `CODEOWNERS` # Defines code ownership for pull requests
- `queries` # Queries to create the db, clean and add content to the tables

## Installation

**Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running the backend)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (for the database)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for cloning the repository)

## Steps to Set Up the Backend

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beatrizheav/ToDoApp_Backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ToDoApp_Backend.git
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (if you don't already have one) and configure your database connection. Example:

   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your-password
   DB_NAME=your-database-name
   ```

5. After cloning the repository, navigate to the `queries` folder, where youâ€™ll find the createDB.sql file with the necessary SQL queries to set up the database.

6. Log in to MySQL and create the database:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

Execute the SQL queries to create the necessary tables. You can find these queries in the `queries` folder on the createDB.sql file. Run each query in the MySQL terminal:

7. Verify that the tables were created by checking the database schema:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

8. After setting up the database, you can start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

9. The server will start, and you can begin using the backend API at `http://localhost:5001` (or whichever port you configured in the project).
